## Goals
1. Separate concerns of app (Make components, replace unnecessary code)
2. Add in Styling for Graph Component that will be in place soon.
3. Bring in animal Icons from 3rd party icon site
4. Change Stats over time depending on activity of animal

## Logs
### `3:30`
Just finished separating parts of the app into different components (StatLogs, Stats, Animal). Went pretty successfully but was a superficial project rather than anything functional. I think that I started doing it because I am scared of working on the functional side but lets work on it!
