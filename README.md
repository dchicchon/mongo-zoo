# mongo-zoo

## Summary
This will be an application that will store autonomous animals that will simulate a zoo. Animals will increase in age, produce offspring, and change behavior based off of property values that are stored in MongoDB from their inital creation.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: Store animals and time for persistence 
- Node.js: Forms entire codebase of front-end and back-end functionality. May switch to Python in the future for learning purposes
- React.js: optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded

## NPM Packages
- Express: Web framework
- Mongoose: Integrate MongoDB to application
- Graph.js: Provide Data Visualization techniques to application
